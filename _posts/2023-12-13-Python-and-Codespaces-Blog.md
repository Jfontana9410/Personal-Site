LaTeX was discussed in class. LaTeX is a prevalent document system in the Mathematics and Statistics world.   LaTeX is a markup language made to create pdf's.  LaTeX is used by a multitude of service providers.  Overleaf is  one we used in class. Overleaf is free and allows the creation of PDF's in a very easy manner.   Overleaf is accessible online and functions somewhat similarly to google drive.  
<p> We also installed a LaTeX codespace on github using a premade repository from someone else.  We talked about various commands in the codespace as well as some functions for Github coding.  Overleaf has extensive tutorials available for many functions of LaTeX.  Another resource on kirelabs.org was discussed for finding the greek symbols and what packages to use when writing them.  
<p> A discussion of how articles are made up continued.   This included discussion of titles, preambles, sections, and creation lines.   The purpose of brackets {} is established for grouping in LaTeX.  Parenthesis are used for comments.  Concepts such as continued functions until line breaks were discussed as well.  Entering equations and greek letters were taught including use of double $ dollar signs or back slash brackets.  Numbering equations was taught.  a gitignore function was displayed to show how to post only what you want to publicly post in a repository.
